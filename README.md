# Meetup recording kit

A guide to help organizers record their meetups.

Meetups should be recording their talks. Presenters spend considerable amounts of time working on their presentations, whether for a 5 minute or 1 hour long talk, it should live longer than that. Recording talks is a win for the community and the presenter. It may seem like a daunting task, but it doesn't have to.

## Video editing

TODO: Document required software.

## Funding

Communities could start a crowdsourcing campaign to raise the necessary funds. First community to do this, should contribute back to this project with what worked and what didn’t.

## Sharing

Equipment is “owned” by a community group like FSN. A calendar can be shared to allow other nearby meetups and groups to use the equipment. Documentation and processes are shared and iterated on.
